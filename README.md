Ok here we go, to memcache your default Tbdev 09 source its really simple. First ensure your memcache install is correct and the memcache server is running. Once thats done this mod is a five minute job.

Upload class_cache.php to include folder.

Next you will include that file as a require once on the top of bittorrent.php :

That loads the class for use now. Next add this under it and your ready to rock and start adding memcache to your code.

Simple as that, this post presumes you have memcache installed and running. Now you can add any modification done here that has memcache added.
